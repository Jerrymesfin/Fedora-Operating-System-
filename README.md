# installation 
Download the Fedora ISO from the official website to your computer.
Use a tool like Rufus or Balena Etcher to create a bootable USB drive.
Restart your computer and boot from the USB by changing BIOS/UEFI settings.
Launch the installer from the Fedora live environment and follow the setup steps.
After installation, reboot the system, remove the USB, and Fedora is ready to use.

# system call 
Fedora OS uses system calls to let programs interact with the Linux kernel.
Common system calls include read(), write(), open(), fork(), and exec().
They handle tasks like file access, memory, and process management.
Applications access system calls through libraries like glibc.
Fedora supports standard POSIX system calls for development use.
